Rebuild Thunderbird popstate
----------------------------

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, CAVEAT EMPTOR, ASSUMES USER KNOWNS WHAT S/HE IS DOING

Simple PHP script to rebuild the Thunderbird's popstate.dat file. Primarily
useful when Thunderbird crashes and after starts retrieving all messages
that have been kept on the mail server. Default file that will be generated
is popstate.dat.GENERATED. If you change this to the popstate.dat file in
the appropriate Thunderbird directory, please make sure that Thunderbird is
closed, otherwise you might have more problems.

Please note that no attempt has been made to make this the best code I ever
wrote...

NB: Windows support is there, but never tested!

Usage
-----
usage: rebuild_popstate.php [-d] [-i n] [-s] [-v] [-f file] server [ port ]

	-d      debug flag
	-f      output filename (if popstate.dat, Thunderbird needs to be closed!)

	-v      verbose flag
