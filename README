Rebuild Thunderbird popstate
----------------------------

Simple PHP script to rebuild the Thunderbird's popstate.dat file. Primarily
useful when Thunderbird crashes and after starts retrieving all messages
that have been kept on the mail server.

Please note that no attempt has been made to make this the best code I ever
wrote...

Usage
-----
usage: rebuild_popstate.php [-d] [-i n] [-s] [-v] [-f file] server [ port ]
    -d      debug flag
	-i      ignore the last n messages (for if you don't have them yet)
	-s      use for secure POP3 (SSL/TLS)
	-v      verbose flag
	-f      output filename
